                nixandpeace, sometimes going by n_a_p, creates soundscapes that gently float through the realms of ambient music, while incorporating detailed patterns of IDM, andexperimental electronic sounds. Their approach to sound design is all about the details, including textural and tonal sounds that create immersive listening experience for n_a_p’s fans.

                Coming from the Lithuanian coast of Klaipėda, n_a_p finds significant inspiration in its urban rhythm, the contrasting moods of day and night, and its overall atmosphere, which fills their compositions with a distinct sense of place and feeling. Beyond this, some of nixandpeace's music arises from personal experiences and raw emotions, that you hear in their sound.
